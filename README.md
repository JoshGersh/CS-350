# CS-350

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project I worked on involved utilizing embedded systems to build a prototype thermostat. The development process integrated I2C, UART, and GPIO functionalities to successfully complete the project.

# What did you do particularly well?
I excelled in designing the state machines, ensuring that their functionalities remained independent of one another. This allowed for the seamless integration of additional timers into the task scheduler.

# Where could you improve?
Recently, I've experienced a challenging few week which affected my timeliness and productivity. I am actively seeking ways to enhance my performance and make notable improvements in my work.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Gaining a deeper comprehension of low-level coding principles will contribute to enhancing the efficiency of my code. It will also enable me to optimize resource utilization and improve the overall performance of my applications.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I incorporated detailed comments within my code and then meticulously formatted it to ensure a neat and organized appearance. Additionally, I maintained consistency throughout the entire coding process for enhanced readability and coherence.
